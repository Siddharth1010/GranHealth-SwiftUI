# GranHealth

## Our Goal

Research shows that 70% of senior citizens suffer from Alzheimers and other neurological conditions, apart from regular health issues. In some cases, they forget where they are. This could cause potential harm and make it extremely difficult for us to track them down. GranHealth is an iOS application that a person can use to monitor the health, fitness and location status of an elderly family member / loved one.  

## How it Works

Apple Watches are equipped with sensors that measure parameters such as Heart Rate and ECG along with the calculation of fitness data. We extract such data at regular intervals and transfer it to FireStore. This data is accessed by the users iPhone and can be monitored. Data leak will not be a problem as a connection will establish only when both the iPhones are logged in with the same credentials.
